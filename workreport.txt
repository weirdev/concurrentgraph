Week 1:
    Implemented several different strategies for disease spread simulation.
    Classified relationships as per edge, per transmitting node, or per receiving node
    Edge:
        Interaction probability
    Transmitting node:
        Disease transmission rate
        Disease shedding rate (parameterized by time infected)
    Receiving node:
        Immunity

    First I constructed a stochastic looped simulation (CS1)
        Worst case O(t*n^2)
        At every step, for every node, check for infection from each of its neighbors

    Next I constructed a stochastic simulation using generalized matrix vector multiplication
        Generalized MVM replaces standard (*, +) MVM with any two communitive operators (op1, op2)
        With op1 = (a, b) => 1.0 - a*b, I use (op1, *) MVM to compute the probability, for each node, 
            that an infection will not occur.
        I then use this calculated probability to calculate, for each node, whether it has been infected
        Worst case: t * (parallelizable O(n^2) MVM operations + parallelizable O(n) decisions on node state)

    I experimented with deterministic simulations
        This was somewhat less sucessful, I was able to create efficient working simulations, but only if shedding was ignored
